# using-skillet changelog

Earlier history lives in the repo-level CHANGELOG.md.

## 0.1.5 - 2026-08-11

- Routed **fleet-conductor** under Review and ship for campaign and multi-repo landing work.

## 0.1.4 - 2026-08-08

- The `brigade-work` routing entry now references the canonical Brigade process model (`docs/brigade-process-model.md`) instead of restating the loop.

## 0.1.3 - 2026-08-08

- Labeled the `brigade-work` route as provided by Brigade (wired in by `brigade init`), not shipped by skillet, and named the fallback when Brigade is absent: skip the route and verify directly per `check`.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-08-08

- The `brigade-work` route now shows the complete atomic verification form with `--target`, `--command`, and `--capture` arguments.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-07-09

- The `brigade-work` routing entry now describes closing the measured loop: brief at start, verify via `brigade work verify run` (or capture from a run receipt), outcome capture, and receipt export to MiseLedger when installed, so the next run gets an evidence brief with a measurable `brief_hit_rate` instead of only a handoff.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-08

- Added skill.json metadata (tests, changelog) for the Brigade skill registry.
